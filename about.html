<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Barbara, 35 years old. I am living in Berlin, Germany, with my 4year old little girl.</p>

<p>I am a German teacher by profession and just recently started coding after a friend convinced me. I started off and liked it right away.</p>

<p>So now IÂ´m spending my evenings sitting here and coding my first website.</p>
